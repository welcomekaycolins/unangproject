<html><head></head><body><h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Colins. My journey started at sea, working as a seaman for several contracts before life steered me toward <br>
  a new path in the call center industry. It’s been a big shift, and I’m still figuring out where I truly belong, <br>
  but every experience has taught me something valuable about resilience and adaptability. <br>
</p>

<p>One thing I know for sure is that being a father to my 3-year-old daughter is the most fulfilling role I’ve ever had. <br>
  My greatest goal is to give her the best life possible, grounded in faith and love for God. She inspires me every day <br>
  to keep pushing forward, even when the road feels uncertain. <br>
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy woodworking—a craft that lets me create something tangible and meaningful. Recently, <br>
  I’ve started studying web design, and this website marks my very first project. It’s a small step toward exploring <br>
  new opportunities and building a future that combines creativity, technology, and purpose. <br>
